This is a sample contract from a tutorial on the [Ethereum Foundation website](https://ethereum.org/token).

This contract has been deployed to the Ropsten test network and can be viewed on Etherscan [here](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xadea1a8403c7a569f630ca8e9de6b95caa7daa87).

This contract creates a new digital currency called luckyCoin (☘️), and there are ☘️ 888,888.88 in circulation. Here's my initial understanding of how this contract works:

- From my test account I can mint new luckyCoins, set the buy and sell price for luckyCoin, and freeze accounts (preventing the accounts ).
- Any other externally owned account (EOA) can transfer luckyCoins to other addresses and buy and sell luckyCoin for Ether.
